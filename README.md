# Pi_Remote_AT-AT
Remote control Lego AT-AT using Raspberry Pi

Small project as proof of concept for me for future projects by using Lego power connectors alongside a Raspberry Pi and to practice motor control.

Started by constructing an old AT-AT motorised set. Then cutting and soldering the contacts of one of the Lego connectors, before connecting through a
motor controller and using a 9V battery for a bit extra power rather than using the Raspberry Pi's 5V output pin.

I also added a camera for a bit of extra fun.
